    Move `ma_ccdf` to the 2026 period.

    Massachusetts CCFA reads one of two income limits: 85% of state median income for a
    household already enrolled, and a new-applicant limit that PolicyEngine holds at 50%
    before 2026-01-01 and 85% from it. Screening asks the new-applicant question, so at the
    2025 period the program applies the 50% limit -- measured, that moves a two-person
    household's ceiling from $91,139 to $53,611.

    The federal CCDF variables this program used to read had a single 85% limit at any
    period, so the 2025 period cost nothing while they were in use and costs a large share
    of eligible Massachusetts families now. There is no config file for this program --
    `year` is set through the admin -- so the bump ships here rather than as an import that
    could lag the deploy.

    Fails the deploy if the program is on 2025 and the 2026 row is missing. Landing the
    calculator while the program still reads the 2025 period is the one outcome worth
    stopping for: it is silent, and it applies the 50% limit to every Massachusetts
    family screening for childcare. A database that has never imported a config has
    neither the program nor any FederalPoveryLimit row, so there is nothing to move and
    nothing to raise about -- `migrate` on a fresh checkout is unaffected.
