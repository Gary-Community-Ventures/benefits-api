"""Tests for the discovery that builds the key -> class registries.

The failure these guard against is a registry that is quietly *incomplete* — a
program absent rather than an error — so the assertions are about reach: that
discovery finds calculators wherever they live, and finds them once.

Two properties of the walk are load-bearing and easy to break:

- It walks the filesystem rather than using ``pkgutil.walk_packages``, which
  recurses only through directories holding an ``__init__.py``. Program
  directories are not uniformly packages: some hold only a ``spec.md``, and
  ``nc/medicaid`` is a bare namespace directory.
- It filters on where a class is *defined* before marking it seen, so a class
  re-exported by another module is still found at its definition.
