# Every variable in PolicyEngine's `gov.usda.wic.income.sources` (7 CFR 246.7(d)(2)(ii)(A))
# that the screener collects. WIC keeps its own source list and does NOT read
# `school_meal_countable_income`, so a calculator sending none of these gets PE's
# imputation instead of the household's reported income.
#
#     wic_countable_income = add(spm_unit, period, sources) + max_(0, capital_gains)
#
# Of WIC's 24 sources this reaches 14, plus the separate positive-only capital-gains
# term. Measured one field at a time against the private API: each moved
# `wic_countable_income` by the amount sent.
#
# Sent under the source's own name:
#   employment_income, self_employment_income, rental_income, social_security,
#   unemployment_compensation, ssi, tanf, workers_compensation, alimony_income,
#   miscellaneous_income (gifts), financial_assistance (cashAssistanceOther),
#   child_support_received
#
# Reached through a PE `adds` chain, so the field we send and the source differ:
#   taxable_pension_income     -> pension_income            (pension, veteran)
#   taxable_ira_distributions  -> retirement_distributions  (deferredComp)
#   long_term_capital_gains    -> capital_gains             (investment) -- the term,
#                                                           not a source; negatives clamp to 0
#
# `ssi` and `tanf` are dual-role: each sends the reported amount, or None so PE computes
# its own.
#
# The 10 sources we never populate split into three kinds:
#
#   Money we do count, just under a different source. PE keeps SSDI, SS survivor and SS
#   dependent benefits in `social_security` (which `adds` social_security_disability /
#   _survivors / _dependents / _retirement), so the screener's sSDisability, sSSurvivor
#   and sSDependent are counted there. PE's standalone `disability_benefits` and
#   `survivor_benefits` are the NON-Social-Security buckets — they are additive with
#   `social_security`, not overlapping. Likewise `veteran` income counts, but it goes out
#   as taxable_pension_income -> pension_income rather than `veterans_benefits`, and
#   `investment` counts through the capital-gains term rather than `dividend_income` /
#   `interest_income`.
#
#   Money we collect and drop. The screener's state disability types -- cOSDisability
#   (CO), stateDisability (TX/MA) and iLStateDisability (IL) -- are exactly what PE's
#   `disability_benefits` holds, and no dependency reads them, so WIC never sees that
#   income. `boarder` is the same story (it arguably belongs in rental_income). Both are
#   real undercounts, in four of the six WIC states.
#
#   Money the screener never asks about: military_service_income, gi_cash_assistance,
#   strike_benefits, educational_assistance, railroad_benefits.

# shape as `wic_income` above, which carries the same four.

# wider base than the federal CCDF test this replaced: `ccdf_income` adds `market_income`
# alone, so benefit income never reached it. A calculator sending only the taxable set would
# read $0 of countable income for a household living on Social Security and pass it.

#
# Three sources are deliberately not populated:
#
#   `veterans_benefits`. The `veteran` stream already reaches CCFA through
#   taxable_pension_income -> pension_income, so the money is counted -- just not under its
#   own name. Routing it properly needs PensionIncomeWithoutVeteranDependency, which writes a
#   different value to `taxable_pension_income` than the eight other MA programs sending
#   PensionIncomeDependency. That is a Slot disagreement, and it would split every MA screen
#   into a second PolicyEngine request to buy a distinction no CCFA formula draws.
#
#   `military_retirement_pay`. The screener does not collect it.
#
#   `dividend_income` / `interest_income`. The screener's single `investment` stream goes out
#   as `long_term_capital_gains`, and CCFA's list exempts capital gains. There is no split of
#   that stream to send here.
#
# Not here either, and inert rather than missing: `miscellaneous_income` (gifts) and
# `long_term_capital_gains`. Both count toward the federal `market_income` this replaced and
# neither appears in CCFA's list, so listing them would only let a missing-data can_calc()
# suppress the program over income CCFA does not read.
