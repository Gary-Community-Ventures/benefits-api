    Age as of December 31 of the year being claimed.

    ``AgeDependency`` reports age on the screening date, which understates by one year
    anybody whose birthday falls later in the calendar year. A rule that awards a benefit
    on age "attained on or before December 31" of the claim year needs the end-of-year
    age, or a household screened in August qualifies only if it screens again in
    December.

    The claim year is the period the variable is being sent at, which comes from the
    program's configured year, so this follows a program rolled forward to a new year
    without anybody remembering to change a constant here. It used to be a class attribute
    on a subclass hardcoded to 2026, which would have gone on sending 2026 ages under a
    2027 period.

    Both this and ``AgeDependency`` write ``age``, so a screen carrying both splits into two
    PolicyEngine requests for any member whose birthday falls later in the year (see
    ``build_pe_input``). That is the intended cost: age on the screening date is the right
    input for a program whose eligibility is judged today, and the end-of-year age is right
    for one judged over a tax year, and no single value serves both.

    Falls back to the screening-date age when the member's birth year is unknown, or when
    there is no period to read a year from.

    Weekly hours worked, taken from hourly income streams and approximated from the

    Only *earned* income counts. The approximation branch divides income by a wage,
    which is only meaningful for money paid for work: run over an unearned stream it
    invents hours nobody worked, and PolicyEngine's SNAP/TANF work screens read this
    field. A 45-year-old with $2,000/mo of SSDI would otherwise be credited ~69
    "work" hours a week and clear every work requirement.

    Subclasses override ``minimum_wage`` with their state's rate; the federal floor
    is the conservative default, since a lower wage buys more approximated hours.

    Reported hours are floored at ``assumed_weekly_hours`` for anyone old enough for a
    SNAP work test to reach (``work_test_minimum_age``). PolicyEngine dropped this
    field's 40-hour default in 1.815.1, and its SNAP work screens deny the *whole* SPM
    unit when any member reads under 30 hours (20 for ABAWD) without an exemption --
    ``meets_snap_work_requirements`` is ANDed into ``is_snap_eligible`` and categorical
    eligibility does not override it. We collect income, not employment: an adult with
    no earned income may be working unpaid, between jobs, or under a waiver or the
    ABAWD grace period, and part-time earnings say nothing about work *registration*,
    which is what the general requirement actually tests. Screening errs inclusive, so
    the floor asserts the work test is met rather than denying on data we never asked
    for -- the same result PolicyEngine's own default produced, now stated explicitly
    (MFB-1637).

    The floor reaches every consumer of this field on purpose. All programs in a screen
    share one payload, so one value per member per screen was a hard constraint when this
    was written, and it costs accuracy on the field's other readers: ``tx_ccs``'s work
    requirement and the MA TAFDC/EAEDC dependent-care deductions both read hours and both
    get more generous. Accepted deliberately; modelling the SNAP work test properly is
    follow-up work.

    Payload assembly can now answer disagreeing programs with a second request rather than
    failing, so the constraint is a cost rather than a wall -- but a per-reader value would
    buy accuracy with a round trip, which is a trade to make deliberately and not a reason to
    split this field today.
