"""Support for tests that run a PolicyEngine calculator end to end.

These build a household, call one PolicyEngine calculator, and assert on the eligibility and
value it returns. Because the answer comes from PolicyEngine rather than from our code, such
tests are marked ``@pytest.mark.integration`` and run against a recorded VCR cassette: live
once when the program is implemented, then replayed in CI. See docs/TESTING.md for the
record/replay commands.

Where the assertions come from is up to the caller — today that is usually a program's
``spec.md`` Test Scenarios section, mirrored one test per scenario, but nothing here depends
on that.

Three things have to hold for a PolicyEngine call to be replayable from a cassette, and all
three are handled here:

1. **Explicit primary keys.** ``pe_input`` keys ``household.people`` by ``str(member.id)``
   and ``PrivateApiSim.value`` reads the response back by that same key. A cassette recorded
   under different auto-increment pks neither matches the request nor can be read, so
   ``make_screen``/``add_member`` require ids.
2. **A pinned model version.** ``determine_pe_version`` falls back to the floating "current"
   alias when nothing is pinned, which makes the recorded body non-reproducible; an unpinned
   request carrying a version-gated input also fires a second HTTP call (GET /versions/us).
   ``pin_pe_version`` removes both.
3. **A bearer token that isn't fetched during replay.** The auth0 host is in VCR's
   ``ignore_hosts`` so the token exchange is never written to a cassette (its response body
   is a real token). ``PE_RECORD=1`` fetches one live; every other run seeds a placeholder
   and touches no network at all.

These helpers run exactly one POST to household.api per scenario, which is what makes a
cassette hold a single meaningful interaction.

A pinned version and ``VCR_MODE=all`` are incompatible by construction — PolicyEngine only
serves what ``current``/``frontier`` currently resolve to — so these tests skip under ``all``
rather than fail a release. Re-recording is always also the act of adopting a new version.
