"""Household builders and a base test case for custom (MFB) calculator tests.

The PolicyEngine side of `pe_integration` builds a household for a recorded request,
so its ids are explicit and its amounts are verbatim from a spec scenario. A custom
calculator reads the same `Screen` but computes locally, so nothing here needs a fixed
primary key and a test can let Django assign them.

What a custom test needs, measured across the files that hand-roll a household today:
a white label always, an income stream usually, and a `Program` row carrying an FPL year
in the 13 files whose calculator reads one. The larger group — 76 files — stands up a
`Mock` program instead, because their calculators never touch it; those set
`needs_program_row = False` and skip the translation rows a real `Program` writes.
`CustomCalculatorTestCase` supplies all of it and runs the calculator, so a test reads as
household → assertion.

    A calculator reading an area median income asks `hud_client`, which is constructed at
    import time and calls HUD over the network. `limit` is the figure HUD would return for
    this household, so the scenario states an income limit the way it states an income.

    The client is bound per calculator module (`from ... import hud_client`), so the patch
    target follows `calculator_class`; patching the integration package would miss every
    calculator. All three lookups are stubbed, because a calculator choosing between the
    standard and the approximated limit is asserting on which one it called.

    `limit` may instead be a dict keyed by AMI percentage — `{"60%": 60_000, "80%": 80_000}`
    — for a calculator that compares a household against several bands. Any percentage not
    named returns 0.

    `limit` may also be a callable, which becomes the lookup's `side_effect` — for a test
    where what HUD was *asked* matters as much as what it returned.

    `payment_standard` is the ZIP-level SAFMR or metro FMR a voucher calculator reads
    through `get_screen_payment_standard`, which is a separate lookup from the AMI bands.

    `unavailable=True` raises `HudIncomeClientError` from the AMI lookups, and
    `payment_standard_unavailable=True` from the payment-standard lookup, for the tests
    covering what a calculator does when HUD is down. They are separate because a voucher
    calculator can survive losing one and not the other.
