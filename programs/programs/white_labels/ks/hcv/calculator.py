    """
    KS Housing Choice Voucher (Section 8) — an ongoing tenant-based rental subsidy,
    statewide across Kansas' public housing agencies. MFB custom calculator, modelled
    on ``IlHcv``.

    Eligibility: annual income (24 CFR 5.609, not raw gross) at or below HUD's
    published Very Low Income limit — 50% AMI — for the household's county and size.
    Federal rule allows five further routes above that limit (24 CFR 982.201(b)(1)),
    none of which holds statewide and none of which the screener can observe, so the
    modelled gate is deliberately narrowing: a household the screener rejects on
    income may still be admissible at its local agency. That is a Product-approved
    exception to the default-inclusive handling of data gaps, surfaced in the program
    description.

    Assumed met (unobservable): the mandatory and discretionary denial grounds
    (24 CFR 982.553 / 982.552), eviction history, and the student restriction of
    24 CFR 5.612. **No asset or property gate is applied** — ``household_assets``
    is not HUD's *net family assets*, so comparing it against the § 5.618 threshold
    would compare two different quantities, and HUD Notice PIH 2026-15 defers HOTMA
    §§ 102/104 enforcement to 2027-01-01. The § 5.617 earned-income disallowance and
    the § 5.609(a)(2) imputed asset return are likewise not modelled.

    Benefit value: monthly HAP = min(payment standard, gross rent) − total tenant
    payment, floored, annualized. The payment standard is 100% of the FY2026
    FMR — or the ZIP-level Small Area FMR in the two Kansas metros HUD designates
    mandatory-SAFMR, Wichita and Kansas City — which is an MFB statewide estimation
    convention, since a PHA may set its own anywhere from 90% to 110% and MFB does
    not capture the administering agency. Welfare rent and minimum rent are both
    modelled at $0, as Wichita's Administrative Plan states for that locality.

    Not modelled (Benefit Value only, not eligibility): the utility allowance, the
    § 5.611(a)(3) medical and (a)(4) child care deductions, and mixed-family
    proration — the payment is computed unprorated.
