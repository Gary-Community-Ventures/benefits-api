"""
Unit tests for the KS Housing Choice Voucher calculator.

Every scenario in `spec.md` has a test in `TestKsHcvSpecScenarios`, named for its
scenario number, asserting both eligibility and the exact benefit value. The
scenarios' HUD figures — the FY2026 Very Low Income limits and the FMRs/SAFMRs
quoted in the spec — are passed in rather than fetched, so the tests pin the
calculator's arithmetic without touching the HUD API.

Ages are built the way the calculator reads them: from a `birth_year_month` date
run through the real `HouseholdMember.age_from_date` against the spec's pinned
reference date, 2026-08-27. The mock's raw `age` field is left `None` on purpose,
so any calculator that reads it instead of `calc_age()` fails these tests rather
than passing by coincidence.
