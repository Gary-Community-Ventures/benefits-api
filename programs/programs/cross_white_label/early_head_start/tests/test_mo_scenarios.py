"""
Receipt-contract regression scenarios for MO Early Head Start — one test per Test Scenario
in ``specs/mo.md``.

The Head Start suite's module docstring
(``cross_white_label/head_start/tests/test_mo_scenarios.py``) explains the contract and the
income band these scenarios depend on; both suites run the same Missouri household and
differ only in which calculator reads it. Kept as two suites rather than one because a
cassette records one calculator's payload, and ``mo_early_head_start`` sends a
``PregnancyDependency`` that ``mo_head_start`` does not.

In short: $2,600/month is above ``spm_unit_fpg`` ($27,320 for this household of three), so
Early Head Start's ordinary income pathway is closed, and below Missouri SNAP's
simulated-eligibility ceiling, so PolicyEngine still returns a would-be SNAP benefit the
receipt contract has to suppress for a non-reporter. Moving the income out of that band
makes the negative scenario pass for the wrong reason.
