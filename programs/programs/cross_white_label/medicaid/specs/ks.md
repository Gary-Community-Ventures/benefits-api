# Implement KanCare (Medicaid) (KS) Program

## Program Details

- **Program**: KanCare (Medicaid)
- **State**: KS
- **White Label**: ks
- **Calculator Type**: PE Custom (existing) — `KsKanCare(Medicaid)`, a subclass of the federal PE `medicaid` calculator (pattern: CO/NC/MA/WA)
- **Research Date**: 2026-06-23

## Eligibility Criteria

A person qualifies by meeting the **general requirements** and **one categorical pathway**. Kansas has **not** expanded Medicaid, so non-disabled, non-pregnant, childless adults under 65 have no pathway at any income. Dollar figures are monthly, from KFMAM Appendix F-8 ("Kansas Medical Assistance Standards," Rev 04-26; MAGI standards updated 4/1/26; PDF confirmed directly).

### General requirements (all pathways)

1. **Kansas residency**
   - Screener fields: `zipcode`, `county`
   - Source: K.A.R. 129-6-55 ("Residence, citizenship, and alienage"); 42 CFR 435.403

2. **U.S. citizen or qualified non-citizen**
   - Configured at the program level via `legal_status_required` — **not** a data gap. Set to `["citizen", "refugee", "gc_5plus", "otherWithWorkPermission"]`. Kansas has not adopted the ICHIA/CHIPRA §214 option, so LPRs within the 5-year bar (`gc_5less`) are excluded. `otherWithWorkPermission` is kept as an over-inclusive catch-all covering COFA migrants (work-authorized, no green card, no waiting period) and some humanitarian parolees, per MFB's over-include-and-explain principle.
   - Source: KFMAM §2040–2048 "Citizenship and Alien Status" (§2043 = no-wait eligible non-citizens incl. COFA migrants §2043.12; §2044 = LPRs/parolees eligible after the 5-yr bar; §2040 = non-qualified → emergency only; §2040 NOTE = undocumented parent + citizen child → child still covered); K.A.R. 129-6-55; 8 U.S.C. §1613; KFF State Health Facts, "Medicaid/CHIP Coverage of Lawfully-Residing Immigrant Children and Pregnant Women" (Jan 2026) — Kansas = No/No, https://www.kff.org/affordable-care-act/state-indicator/medicaid-chip-coverage-of-lawfully-residing-immigrant-children-and-pregnant-women/

### Categorical pathways (qualify under any one)

3. **Infant under age 1** — household MAGI ≤ **171% FPL** (F-8: HH1 $2,275; HH3 $3,894)
   - Screener fields: `birth_year`/`birth_month`, income streams, `household_size`
   - Source: KFMAM Appendix F-8 §A.1 ("171%* PW & Infants under age 1"); K.A.R. 129-6-72; 42 CFR 435.118 (171% includes the 5-pt MAGI disregard; PE `infant` = 1.71)

4. **Child age 1–5** — household MAGI ≤ **154% FPL effective** (F-8 statutory 149%, HH1 $1,982, + 5-pt income disregard)
   - Screener fields: `birth_year`/`birth_month`, income streams, `household_size`
   - Source: KFMAM Appendix F-8 §A.1 ("149% Children age 1-5"); K.A.R. 129-6-72; 42 CFR 435.118 (PE `young_child` = 1.54)

5. **Child age 6–18** — household MAGI ≤ **138% FPL effective**. F-8 covers ages 6–18 under Medicaid to **113%** (HH1 $1,503) plus Medicaid-funded **M-CHIP to 133%** (HH1 $1,769); with the 5-pt disregard PE's `medicaid` ceiling = 138% (`older_child` = 1.38). Coverage from ~134–255% FPL is separate CHIP, not this calculator.
   - Screener fields: `birth_year`/`birth_month`, income streams, `household_size`
   - Source: KFMAM Appendix F-8 §A.1 ("113% / 113-133% Children age 6-18"); K.A.R. 129-6-72; 42 CFR 435.118

6. **Pregnant** — household MAGI ≤ **171% FPL**; the unborn child is counted in household size
   - Screener fields: `pregnant`, income streams, `household_size`
   - Source: KFMAM Appendix F-8 §A.1 (171% column); K.A.R. 129-6-71; 42 CFR 435.116

7. **Parent / caretaker relative** of a dependent child in the household — household MAGI ≤ **38% FPL** (F-8: HH1 $506, HH3 $866). Requires a dependent child present; a childless adult cannot qualify here.
   - Screener fields: `relationship` (child member present), income streams, `household_size`
   - Source: KFMAM Appendix F-8 §A.1 ("38%* Caretakers and Children"); K.A.R. 129-6-70; 42 CFR 435.110

8. **Aged 65+, blind, or disabled (ABD / SSI-related)** — countable income ≤ the **SSI federal benefit rate** ($994/mo individual, $1,491/mo couple) **and** countable resources ≤ the ABD limit ($2,000 individual / $3,000 couple). Screened on income, categorical status, **and assets** (see note).
   - Screener fields: `birth_year`/`birth_month` (65+), `disabled` / `long_term_disability` / `visually_impaired`, income streams, `household_assets`
   - ⚠️ **Asset test is screened, shared with the Medicare Savings Program.** KanCare's ABD pathway has a $2,000 individual / $3,000 couple resource limit, which PE gates on via `ssi_countable_resources`. MFB sends `SsiCountableResourcesDependency` (`household_assets / num_adults` per adult), so an over-asset applicant returns ineligible for the ABD pathway. The Medicare Savings Program's own asset test (`msp_asset_eligible`) reads the **same** `ssi_countable_resources` variable, and all programs on a screen share one PolicyEngine simulation, so that input is set once per person for every program at once — KanCare and MSP must therefore screen assets identically. KanCare's asset handling matches every other state that offers both Medicaid and MSP (CO/IL/MA). The per-adult sharding errs lax (a third adult under-counts an applicant's resources, since PE sums only the applicant's marital/tax unit), the acceptable over-inclusive direction for a screener.
   - ⚠️ **Disability determination — inclusivity assumption + build mapping.** PE's ABD/disability eligibility keys off `is_ssi_disabled` (an SSA determination), computed as `meets_ssi_disability_criteria & ~ssi_engaged_in_sga` — not the generic `is_disabled`. The screener captures `disabled`/`long_term_disability` and SSDI receipt but can't make a formal SSA determination, so self-reported disability/SSDI signals are treated as meeting the criterion (mapped to `meets_ssi_disability_criteria` — see Implementation Notes) and the agency makes the official determination at application. Without this mapping, a disabled, under-65, not-yet-on-SSI applicant is wrongly excluded (non-expansion KS has no adult-expansion fallback).
   - For a low-income senior/ABD applicant, PE's binding pathway is the SSI-recipient route (FBR-based: countable income = income − $20 general exclusion, eligible up to ~$1,014/mo), not the lower 75%-FPL optional-senior pathway. PE's threshold slightly exceeds the KS $994 standard, so there is no under-inclusion gap at the $978–$994 income band.
   - Source: KFMAM Appendix F-8 §A.2 ("Presumptive Medicaid Disability: SI-Related… must not exceed the applicable SSI federal benefit rate") + §E Resource Standards ("SSI Medical $2,000 / $3,000"); K.A.R. 129-6-85 ("aged, blind, or disabled… based on social security administration criteria" — confirmed verbatim), 129-6-103, 129-6-106–110

9. **SSI recipient** — receiving SSI confers automatic Medicaid eligibility
   - Screener fields: income type `sSI`, or `current_benefits` (`screen.has_benefit("ssi")`). Do not use `receives_ssi` — that field exists only on the supplemental Energy Calculator, not the general screener.
   - Source: KanCare Eligibility ("Persons currently receiving SSI payments"); K.A.R. 129-6-85; 42 CFR 435.120 (KS is an SSI-criteria state, not 209(b); PE `ssi_recipient/is_covered` KS = true)

### Explicitly not eligible

10. **Childless, non-disabled, non-pregnant adults under 65** — no pathway at any income (Kansas declined ACA adult expansion, 42 CFR 435.119). This includes the 19–20 "young adult" category (`is_young_adult_for_medicaid`), which KS also sets to −∞.
    - Source: PE `adult/income_limit` and `young_adult/income_limit` KS = −∞; KanCare covered-groups list

### Data gaps (screener cannot verify)

11. **Medically needy / spend-down** ⚠️ *data gap* — someone over the income limit with high medical bills can still qualify by "spending down." Screener fields: none (doesn't collect monthly incurred medical expenses). Handling: surfaced in the `description` ("if your income is above the limit but you have high medical bills, you may still qualify through a 'spend-down'"); a spend-down expense field would be complex and invasive to screen.
    - Source: F-8's own current standard for this pathway is SSI-FBR-aligned ($994/$1,491); PE's parameter is a stale 2018 load ($475) — tracked as PE #8361, bypassed here since the screener never feeds this input

12. **Foster care (current + former foster youth to age 26)** — both are mandatory federal categories where income is irrelevant, and in non-expansion KS they would otherwise fall through as "childless adults." Screener fields: `household_member.was_in_foster_care` (Step 5, "Ever in foster care, even briefly") and `household_member.relationship`. Handling: **field shipped, pathway still open.** The field ships as a per-member boolean and does reach PolicyEngine in KS (via the Head Start `pe_inputs` and the shared per-screen payload), but ⚠️ **PolicyEngine's Medicaid does not read it.** `medicaid_work_requirement_eligible` is a work-*requirement exemption*, not the mandatory categorical pathway this criterion describes (42 U.S.C. § 1396a(a)(10)(A)(i)(IX)); an exemption cannot make an otherwise-ineligible childless adult eligible in non-expansion KS. That variable is also in no calculator's `pe_outputs` and appears nowhere in this codebase, so we never read it. Measured on a KS screen (22-year-old, `was_in_foster_care=true` confirmed in the payload): `medicaid` stayed `0.0`, `medicaid_category` stayed `"NONE"`, `is_medicaid_eligible` stayed `false`. PolicyEngine's `medicaid_category` enum has no foster-care value. Adding `FosterCareDependency` to the Medicaid `pe_inputs` would therefore change nothing on its own — closing this criterion needs either a PolicyEngine foster category or a custom KS pathway, and belongs to the Medicaid ticket. Keep the `description` surfacing as the real backstop meanwhile. See `programs/programs/FOSTER_CARE_SCREENER_GAPS.md`.

13. **Adoption-assistance children** ⚠️ *data gap — still open* — a mandatory federal IV-E category named on the KanCare eligibility page alongside foster children; most also qualify via the income-based child pathways (criteria 3–5), so the false-negative risk is smaller. Screener fields: none. Handling: `description` surfacing. The shipped `was_in_foster_care` tile reads "Ever in foster care, even briefly" and deliberately does not mention adoption support, so an adoptee who doesn't consider themselves foster-placed won't tick it. Widening the copy was considered and rejected for that pass — it would blur the single question five foster-care programs gate on. **This remains a genuine eligibility gap, not a closed question:** the intended resolution is a later iteration adding granularity to the foster care question (a follow-up on exit type — aged out / adopted from care / kinship guardianship — which would serve this criterion and several Foster Care milestone programs at once). See the foster-care gap register in `programs/programs/FOSTER_CARE_SCREENER_GAPS.md`.

14. **12-month postpartum extension** ⚠️ *data gap* — the screener's `pregnant` field only captures *currently* pregnant; a recently-postpartum applicant can fall through. Screener fields: `pregnant` only. Handling: `description` surfacing ("there are other ways to qualify too — apply if you're unsure"); a dedicated field would add intake friction for a narrow window.

15. **Early Detection Works (breast/cervical cancer), TB-inpatient** ⚠️ *data gap* — diagnosis-specific, tiny populations. Screener fields: none. Handling: covered by a generic catch-all line in the `description` rather than named individually (naming them would alarm/clutter for almost no one).

**Out of scope, not data gaps:** Working Healthy disabled buy-in and HCBS/long-term care are separate programs.

## Priority Criteria

None. KanCare Medicaid has no priority/waitlist tiers — eligibility is categorical and entitlement-based.

## Benefit Value

**Shape:** Insurance coverage (non-cash). Value = monthly dollar amount per Medicaid category (`medicaid_categories` table, ×12 for the annual figure the calculator returns), following the MFB insurance method (program spend ÷ beneficiaries, by eligibility group) and matching the WA Apple Health precedent. **Eligibility is determined by PolicyEngine; the value table is MFB-set and independent of PE's `medicaid_cost`.**

KS values are derived from FY2023 KS per-enrollee Medicaid & CHIP spending by group (KHI / Kansas Action for Children, confirmed verbatim via kac.org): *"annual Medicaid and CHIP spending averaged $3,644 per pregnant woman, child, or family member, compared to $32,459 per enrollee with a disability and $20,511 per enrollee age 65 and older."* Annual ÷ 12:

| Category | KS monthly value | KS annual value |
|---|---|---|
| INFANT / YOUNG_CHILD / OLDER_CHILD / PREGNANT / PARENT / ADULT / YOUNG_ADULT | $304 | $3,648 |
| AGED | $1,709 | $20,508 |
| DISABLED / SSI_RECIPIENT | $2,705 | $32,460 |
| NONE | $0 | $0 |

KS publishes a single combined MAGI per-enrollee figure ($3,644), so $304/mo applies uniformly across MAGI categories (unlike WA's finer child/adult split). This is an estimate; exact per-household value is returned by the calculator. `value_format: estimated_annual`.

**Edge case:** a person who is both 65+ and disabled gets the **DISABLED** value ($32,460), since MFB's calc checks `is_disabled` before `is_senior` — see Scenario 19.

AGED vs. DISABLED is decided from the screener's own `is_senior`/`is_disabled` flags, not from PE's `medicaid_category` enum. Confirmed via the live PE run: for every ABD-pathway scenario (7, 8, 9, 16, 17, 19), PE's `medicaid_category` returns `SSI_RECIPIENT` uniformly and does not distinguish AGED from DISABLED. The value tier comes from MFB's own age/disability logic, not PE's category enum.

## Implementation Notes

The KS subclass requires these `pe_inputs`/registry changes.

1. **Add a disability→SSI-criterion dependency.** On production PE, `is_ssi_disabled = meets_ssi_disability_criteria & ~ssi_engaged_in_sga`, where `meets_ssi_disability_criteria` is a pure input (defaults False); `is_disabled` does not feed it. Add a dependency mapping the screener's `disabled`/`long_term_disability`/SSDI signals → **`meets_ssi_disability_criteria`** (not by overriding `is_ssi_disabled` directly, so the SGA test still applies — see Scenario 15). Also map `visually_impaired` → PE's **`is_blind`** input (also a pure input, defaults False) — K.A.R. 129-6-85 covers *blind* as a qualifying status distinct from disabled, and `is_blind=True` exempts from SGA entirely (`ssi_engaged_in_sga = (earned_income > $1,690/mo) & ~is_blind`; 20 CFR 416.971). See Scenario 16.
2. **Send assets for the ABD pathway.** Include `SsiCountableResourcesDependency` (→ `ssi_countable_resources`, `household_assets / num_adults` per adult) in the KS `pe_inputs`, so PE gates the ABD pathway on the $2,000/$3,000 resource limit. This must stay consistent with the Medicare Savings Program: `msp_asset_eligible` reads the same `ssi_countable_resources`, and all programs share one PolicyEngine simulation, so the input is either present for both programs or absent for both. Every state that offers both Medicaid and MSP (CO/IL/MA) sends it.

**`show_in_has_benefits_step` = false:** a program gating on Medicaid reads the calculated result through `self.program_eligible("ks_medicaid")`, and "already enrolled" is detected via the Step 8 insurance question — not the Has-Benefits step.

**MFB-layer branches (not PolicyEngine):**
- **Already-enrolled suppression** (Scenario 12). PE Medicaid eligibility takes no insurance/enrollment input. MFB suppresses an already-enrolled household at the display layer via the Step 8 insurance answer / `current_benefits`.
- **No separate unborn enrollee** (Scenario 13). PE models pregnancy via `is_pregnant` on the mother with no separate-unborn entity. MFB enforces "no separate unborn enrollee" in household construction.
- **Immigration / citizenship.** MFB does not send `immigration_status` to PE; eligibility by status is enforced by the config's `legal_status_required` (criterion 2).

## Implementation Coverage

- ✅ Evaluable by the screener/PE: 8 (residency, infant, young child, older child, pregnant, parent/caretaker, ABD, SSI recipient)
- ✅ Handled outside the eligibility calc: 1 (citizenship/immigration → `legal_status_required`)
- ⚠️ True data gaps: 5 (medically needy/spend-down, foster care, adoption-assistance, postpartum extension, Early Detection Works/TB) — each has a concrete disposition (inclusivity assumption, proposed screener field, or description surfacing); none silent

## Test Scenarios

Expected values use the Benefit Value table above (annual figures). ZIP/county pairs: 66603/66604/66044/66502 = Shawnee/Shawnee/Douglas/Riley; 67202 = Sedgwick; 66102 = Wyandotte.

Scenarios 8, 16, and 17 are eligible because of the KS disability-mapping input handling (Implementation Note 1). With the federal `pe_inputs` inherited unchanged, all three would return ineligible. Scenario 7 (senior with assets above the ABD limit) is ineligible and Scenario 7b (assets below the limit) is eligible, per the ABD asset test (Implementation Note 2).

### Scenario 1: Pregnant woman, low income
**What we're checking**: Golden-path pregnancy eligibility (criterion 6), well under the 171% FPL threshold.
**Expected**: Eligible · $3,648/yr (PREGNANT)

**Steps**:
- **Location**: ZIP `66603`, county `Shawnee`
- **Household**: 1 person (MAGI size 2 — unborn counted)
- **Person 1**: Head of Household, born `March 1991` (age 35), female, US citizen, pregnant: yes, employment income `$1,200`/mo, insurance: none

**Why this matters**: The primary regression test for the pregnancy pathway. 171% FPL HH2 = $3,084/mo; $1,200 is well under.

---

### Scenario 2: Pregnant woman near the 171% boundary
**What we're checking**: Pregnancy eligibility just under the FPL ceiling (criterion 6 boundary).
**Expected**: Eligible · $3,648/yr (PREGNANT)

**Steps**:
- **Location**: ZIP `66502`, county `Riley`
- **Household**: 1 person (MAGI size 2)
- **Person 1**: Head of Household, born `September 1996` (age 29), female, US citizen, pregnant: yes, employment income `$2,900`/mo, insurance: none

**Why this matters**: $2,900 is just under the $3,084/mo (171% FPL HH2) ceiling — tests the upper boundary from the eligible side.

---

### Scenario 3: Parent + 2 children, very low income, on SNAP
**What we're checking**: All three household members qualify under separate pathways simultaneously (parent/caretaker + two child age bands), and SNAP receipt doesn't exclude Medicaid.
**Expected**: All eligible · $3,648/yr each (PARENT, OLDER_CHILD, YOUNG_CHILD)

**Steps**:
- **Location**: ZIP `66604`, county `Shawnee`
- **Household**: 3 people
- **Person 1**: Head of Household, born `September 1991` (age 34), female, US citizen, not pregnant/disabled, employment income `$620`/mo, insurance: none, current benefits: SNAP
- **Person 2**: Child, born `March 2018` (age 8), no income
- **Person 3**: Child, born `November 2020` (age 5), no income

**Why this matters**: $620 is under the 38% FPL HH3 limit ($866) for the parent; both kids are well under their respective limits. Confirms SNAP receipt has no bearing on PE Medicaid eligibility.

---

### Scenario 4: Parent just over 38% — children eligible, parent not
**What we're checking**: Per-member independence — a parent over the caretaker income limit doesn't disqualify their children from the child MAGI pathways.
**Expected**: Children eligible ($3,648/yr each); parent ineligible ($0)

**Steps**:
- **Location**: ZIP `66502`, county `Riley`
- **Household**: 3 people
- **Person 1**: Head of Household, born `March 1991` (age 35), female, US citizen, not pregnant/disabled, employment income `$900`/mo, insurance: none
- **Person 2**: Child, born `January 2018` (age 8), no income
- **Person 3**: Child, born `September 2020` (age 5), no income

**Why this matters**: $900 exceeds the 38% FPL HH3 limit ($866) for the parent, but both kids are far under their own limits — tests that eligibility is evaluated per person, not per household.

---

### Scenario 5: Single childless adult, low income — ineligible
**What we're checking**: Non-expansion Kansas has no pathway for childless, non-disabled, non-pregnant adults under 65 at any income (criterion 10).
**Expected**: Not eligible

**Steps**:
- **Location**: ZIP `66604`, county `Shawnee`
- **Household**: 1 person
- **Person 1**: Head of Household, born `February 1981` (age 45), male, US citizen, not pregnant/disabled, no dependent children, employment income `$350`/mo, insurance: none

**Why this matters**: Confirms PE `adult/income_limit` = −∞ for KS regardless of how low income is.

---

### Scenario 6: Childless adult age 64 — ineligible
**What we're checking**: A person just under 65 has no ABD pathway (requires 65+ or disability) and no adult-expansion pathway either (criterion 10).
**Expected**: Not eligible

**Steps**:
- **Location**: ZIP `66604`, county `Shawnee`
- **Household**: 1 person
- **Person 1**: Head of Household, born `December 1961` (age 64), male, US citizen, not disabled, employment income `$250`/mo, insurance: none

**Why this matters**: Distinguishes "not yet 65" from the ABD age trigger — pairs with Scenario 7 (age 66, eligible). The birth month is intentionally late in the year (December) so the applicant is unambiguously age 64 on any run date; a birth month equal to the current month would resolve to age 65 under the platform's month-only age arithmetic and wrongly qualify under the AGED pathway.

---

### Scenario 7: Senior 65+, low income, assets above the $2,000 limit
**What we're checking**: The ABD asset test IS screened (Implementation Note 2) — a senior income-eligible for the ABD pathway but with countable resources over KanCare's $2,000 limit should be **ineligible**.
**Expected**: Ineligible (ABD asset test)

**Steps**:
- **Location**: ZIP `67202`, county `Sedgwick`
- **Household**: 1 person
- **Person 1**: Head of Household, born `April 1960` (age 66), male, US citizen, not disabled, Social Security income `$900`/mo, `household_assets`: `$5,000`, insurance: none

**Why this matters**: Income qualifies ($900 < $994 SSI FBR), but the $5,000 exceeds KanCare's $2,000 ABD individual resource limit, so the ABD asset test returns ineligible.

---

### Scenario 7b: Senior 65+, low income, assets under the $2,000 limit
**What we're checking**: The mirror of Scenario 7 — the same senior with countable resources **under** the ABD limit passes the asset test and is eligible.
**Expected**: Eligible · $20,508/yr (AGED)

**Steps**:
- **Location**: ZIP `67202`, county `Sedgwick`
- **Household**: 1 person
- **Person 1**: Head of Household, born `April 1960` (age 66), male, US citizen, not disabled, Social Security income `$900`/mo, `household_assets`: `$1,500`, insurance: none

**Why this matters**: Income qualifies ($900 < $994 SSI FBR) and $1,500 is under the $2,000 ABD limit → eligible for the AGED pathway. Paired with Scenario 7, confirms the asset test binds at the $2,000 boundary.

---

### Scenario 8: Disabled adult on SSDI, low income
**What we're checking**: The ABD disability pathway via the disability/SSDI → `meets_ssi_disability_criteria` mapping (Implementation Note 1).
**Expected**: Eligible · $32,460/yr (DISABLED)

**Steps**:
- **Location**: ZIP `66604`, county `Shawnee`
- **Household**: 1 person
- **Person 1**: Head of Household, born `May 1976` (age 50), male, US citizen, disabled: yes, receives SSDI, SSDI income `$800`/mo, insurance: none

**Why this matters**: This outcome depends on Implementation Note 1 — without the disability→`meets_ssi_disability_criteria` mapping, PE returns this person ineligible. Contrast with Scenario 15 (same profile, earnings above SGA → ineligible).

---

### Scenario 9: SSI recipient
**What we're checking**: SSI receipt confers automatic Medicaid eligibility (criterion 9).
**Expected**: Eligible · $32,460/yr (DISABLED/SSI_RECIPIENT)

**Steps**:
- **Location**: ZIP `66102`, county `Wyandotte`
- **Household**: 1 person
- **Person 1**: Head of Household, born `June 1985` (age 40), female, US citizen, disabled: yes, SSI income `$943`/mo, `household_assets`: `$1,000`, insurance: none

**Why this matters**: Confirms the SSI-recipient auto-eligibility pathway independent of the ABD income/asset tests.

---

### Scenario 10: Infant under 1 — child eligible, parents not
**What we're checking**: Per-member independence in a 3-person household — an infant qualifies under the higher infant threshold while both parents exceed the parent/caretaker limit.
**Expected**: Infant eligible ($3,648/yr, INFANT); parents ineligible ($0)

**Steps**:
- **Location**: ZIP `66604`, county `Shawnee`
- **Household**: 3 people
- **Person 1**: Head of Household, born `March 1994` (age 32), female, US citizen, not pregnant, employment income `$1,800`/mo, insurance: none
- **Person 2**: Spouse, born `May 1993` (age 33), male, employment income `$800`/mo, insurance: none
- **Person 3**: Child, born `May 2026` (age 0, newborn), no income

**Why this matters**: The combined parental income ($2,600/mo) is well under the infant's own 171% HH3 threshold ($3,894), so the infant qualifies regardless of the parents' income; the parents themselves exceed the 38% HH3 caretaker limit ($866).

---

### Scenario 11: School-age child eligible, parent not
**What we're checking**: A 2-person household where the child qualifies under the older-child threshold while the parent (with employer insurance) exceeds the caretaker limit.
**Expected**: Child eligible ($3,648/yr, OLDER_CHILD); parent ineligible ($0)

**Steps**:
- **Location**: ZIP `66044`, county `Douglas`
- **Household**: 2 people
- **Person 1**: Head of Household, born `March 1985` (age 41), female, US citizen, not pregnant/disabled, employment income `$1,600`/mo, insurance: employer
- **Person 2**: Child, born `September 2014` (age 11), no income, insurance: none

**Why this matters**: Older-child 138% HH2 (≈$2,490) is above the child's own income; parent exceeds 38% HH2 ($685) and separately has employer insurance.

---

### Scenario 12: Already enrolled in KanCare — suppressed at display layer
**What we're checking**: PE has no insurance/enrollment input, so "already enrolled" must be handled MFB-side (Implementation Notes, MFB-layer branches).
**Expected**: PE returns eligible (PREGNANT, $3,648/yr if shown) — but MFB suppresses the result because the household is already enrolled

**Steps**:
- **Location**: ZIP `66604`, county `Shawnee`
- **Household**: 1 person
- **Person 1**: Head of Household, born `September 1991` (age 34), female, US citizen, pregnant: yes, employment income `$400`/mo, insurance: Medicaid, current benefits: Medicaid/KanCare

**Why this matters**: Confirms the dedup rule lives in MFB's display layer (Step 8 insurance / `current_benefits`), not in PE — implement the suppression, don't try to make PE itself return ineligible.

---

### Scenario 13: Future birth date (unborn as separate person) — ineligible as a distinct enrollee
**What we're checking**: PE models pregnancy via `is_pregnant` on the mother with no separate unborn entity — "no separate unborn enrollee" must be an MFB household-construction rule.
**Expected**: Mother eligible · $3,648/yr (PREGNANT); the unborn is **not** a separate PE person / enrollee

**Steps**:
- **Location**: ZIP `66603`, county `Shawnee`
- **Household**: 2 people
- **Person 1**: Head of Household, born `March 1996` (age 30), female, US citizen, pregnant: yes, employment income `$400`/mo, insurance: none
- **Person 2**: Child, born `December 2026` (future / unborn)

**Why this matters**: Run the mother through PE (she's eligible); enforce the no-separate-unborn-person rule in MFB household construction, not PE.

---

### Scenario 14: Young adult age 20, childless, low income — ineligible
**What we're checking**: The distinct 19–20 `young_adult` category, which KS also sets to −∞ (criterion 10) — confirms this branch returns ineligible, not just adults 21+.
**Expected**: Not eligible

**Steps**:
- **Location**: ZIP `66604`, county `Shawnee`
- **Household**: 1 person
- **Person 1**: Head of Household, born `May 2006` (age 20), male, US citizen, not disabled/pregnant, no children, employment income `$300`/mo, insurance: none

**Why this matters**: Covers the 19–20 young-adult category so it isn't mistaken for an omission alongside the general adult-expansion exclusion.

---

### Scenario 15: Disabled adult, earnings above SGA — ineligible edge case
**What we're checking**: The disability mapping (Implementation Note 1) doesn't make every disabled applicant eligible — the SGA earnings test still applies.
**Expected**: Not eligible

**Steps**:
- **Location**: ZIP `66604`, county `Shawnee`
- **Household**: 1 person
- **Person 1**: Head of Household, born `May 1976` (age 50), male, US citizen, disabled: yes, employment income `$2,000`/mo (earned, above the $1,690/mo SGA threshold), insurance: none

**Why this matters**: PE's `is_ssi_disabled = meets_ssi_disability_criteria & ~ssi_engaged_in_sga` — earnings above SGA flip `ssi_engaged_in_sga` true → `is_ssi_disabled` false → no ABD pathway, and the person is over every MAGI limit. Contrast with Scenario 8 (unearned SSDI income, no SGA test).

---

### Scenario 16: Legally blind, under 65, income under FBR
**What we're checking**: The ABD blind pathway via the `visually_impaired` → `is_blind` mapping (Implementation Note 1).
**Expected**: Eligible · $32,460/yr (DISABLED)

**Steps**:
- **Location**: ZIP `66604`, county `Shawnee`
- **Household**: 1 person
- **Person 1**: Head of Household, born `August 1975` (age 50), female, US citizen, visually impaired: yes, disabled: no, employment income `$500`/mo, insurance: none

**Why this matters**: K.A.R. 129-6-85 treats blindness as a qualifying status distinct from disability. Without the `visually_impaired` → `is_blind` mapping, this person returns ineligible despite qualifying under KS law. SGA doesn't apply to blind individuals for the disability-route computation, but this is moot in practice: the $994 FBR income ceiling binds before the $1,690 SGA threshold would, so no blind person earning above SGA would pass the income test regardless.

---

### Scenario 17: Long-term disability only (no `disabled` flag, no SSDI)
**What we're checking**: The disability mapping must cover `long_term_disability` independently of the `disabled` flag and SSDI receipt (Implementation Note 1).
**Expected**: Eligible · $32,460/yr (DISABLED)

**Steps**:
- **Location**: ZIP `66604`, county `Shawnee`
- **Household**: 1 person
- **Person 1**: Head of Household, born `March 1970` (age 56), male, US citizen, long-term disability: yes, disabled: no, no SSDI income, employment income `$600`/mo, insurance: none

**Why this matters**: A partial implementation that only maps the `disabled` flag and SSDI receipt — but not `long_term_disability` — would incorrectly return this person ineligible.

---

### Scenario 18: Aged, income above the SSI FBR — ineligible
**What we're checking**: The ABD income ceiling from the over-income side (complements Scenarios 7 and 8, which test under-income).
**Expected**: Not eligible

**Steps**:
- **Location**: ZIP `67202`, county `Sedgwick`
- **Household**: 1 person
- **Person 1**: Head of Household, born `January 1958` (age 68), male, US citizen, not disabled, Social Security income `$1,100`/mo, insurance: none

**Why this matters**: Countable income = $1,100 − $20 general unearned-income exclusion = $1,080 > $994 SSI FBR → fails the ABD income test, with no MAGI pathway available (non-expansion, no dependents, not pregnant).

---

### Scenario 19: Aged and disabled — DISABLED value, not AGED
**What we're checking**: A person qualifying under both the AGED and DISABLED pathways gets the DISABLED value — MFB's value logic checks `is_disabled` before `is_senior`.
**Expected**: Eligible · $32,460/yr (DISABLED, not the $20,508 AGED value)

**Steps**:
- **Location**: ZIP `67202`, county `Sedgwick`
- **Household**: 1 person
- **Person 1**: Head of Household, born `April 1958` (age 68), male, US citizen, disabled: yes, Social Security retirement `$500`/mo + SSDI `$300`/mo (total `$800`/mo), insurance: none

**Why this matters**: Countable income = $800 − $20 = $780 < $994 SSI FBR. Confirms the value-priority rule documented in the Benefit Value section's edge case — a $12,000/yr difference depending on which pathway MFB's value logic picks.

---

### Scenario 20: Pregnant woman above 171% FPL — ineligible
**What we're checking**: The upper-income bound of the pregnant pathway (complements Scenarios 1 and 2).
**Expected**: Not eligible

**Steps**:
- **Location**: ZIP `66604`, county `Shawnee`
- **Household**: 1 person (MAGI size 2)
- **Person 1**: Head of Household, born `March 1998` (age 28), female, US citizen, pregnant: yes, employment income `$3,500`/mo, insurance: none

**Why this matters**: 171% FPL HH2 = $3,084/mo; $3,500 exceeds it and no other pathway applies (not disabled, no children, non-expansion KS).

---

### Scenario 21: Parent + young child, income above child limits — both ineligible
**What we're checking**: All four child/parent MAGI pathways correctly gate on income from the ineligible side in one household.
**Expected**: Both not eligible

**Steps**:
- **Location**: ZIP `66604`, county `Shawnee`
- **Household**: 2 people
- **Person 1**: Head of Household, born `September 1990` (age 34), female, US citizen, not pregnant/disabled, employment income `$3,500`/mo, insurance: none
- **Person 2**: Child, born `January 2022` (age 4), no income

**Why this matters**: Young child (1–5) 154% HH2 = $2,777/mo and parent 38% HH2 = $685/mo are both far below $3,500 — income also exceeds the 171% HH2 ($3,084) and 138% HH2 ($2,490) thresholds, so an infant or older child in this household would likewise be ineligible.

---

### Scenario 22: Parent + infant, income above the infant's own 171% ceiling — both ineligible
**What we're checking**: The infant pathway's own ceiling (`infant` = 1.71, a distinct PE parameter from `pregnant`) gated from the ineligible side — not yet exercised by any other scenario.
**Expected**: Both not eligible

**Steps**:
- **Location**: ZIP `66604`, county `Shawnee`
- **Household**: 2 people
- **Person 1**: Head of Household, born `January 1991` (age 35), female, US citizen, not pregnant/disabled, employment income `$3,500`/mo, insurance: none
- **Person 2**: Child, born `April 2026` (age 0, infant), no income

**Why this matters**: Infant 171% HH2 = $3,084/mo and parent 38% HH2 = $685/mo are both far below $3,500. Scenario 21 proves the same income fails the young-child (1.54) and parent (0.38) parameters; this scenario proves it independently against the `infant` (1.71) parameter specifically, since a typo'd infant ratio wouldn't be caught by any other scenario.

---

### Scenario 23: Parent + older child, income above the older child's own 138% ceiling — both ineligible
**What we're checking**: The older-child pathway's own ceiling (`older_child` = 1.38, a distinct PE parameter) gated from the ineligible side — not yet exercised by any other scenario.
**Expected**: Both not eligible

**Steps**:
- **Location**: ZIP `66044`, county `Douglas`
- **Household**: 2 people
- **Person 1**: Head of Household, born `March 1985` (age 41), female, US citizen, not pregnant/disabled, employment income `$2,600`/mo, insurance: none
- **Person 2**: Child, born `September 2014` (age 11), no income

**Why this matters**: Older-child 138% HH2 (≈$2,490) and parent 38% HH2 ($685) are both below $2,600. Scenario 11 proves the older-child pathway works on the eligible side; this scenario proves the `older_child` (1.38) parameter specifically fails correctly above its own ceiling, distinct from the young-child (1.54) and infant (1.71) parameters tested elsewhere.

---

Every scenario field (age, `is_pregnant`, income streams, `is_disabled`/`meets_ssi_disability_criteria`, `is_blind`/`visually_impaired`, `ssi`, `ssi_countable_resources`, state) maps to a real PE input. Confirmed via the live PE run, not assumed: SNAP receipt (Scenario 3) and employer insurance (Scenario 11) do not affect PE Medicaid eligibility. Scenarios 1–11 and 14–23 are the PE-computed eligibility-threshold set; Scenarios 12–13 are MFB display/household-construction rules (see Implementation Notes).
