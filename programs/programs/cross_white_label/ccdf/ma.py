class MaCcdf(PolicyEngineSpmCalulator):
    """
    Massachusetts Child Care Financial Assistance (CCFA).

    Reads Massachusetts' own model, ``ma_ccfa_eligible``, rather than the federal CCDF
    passthrough it replaced. PolicyEngine is retiring the federal CCDF eligibility
    variables and this was their last consumer here; they also made us assert
    reason-for-care unconditionally, which the MA model tests for real.

    ``program_code`` stays ``ma_ccdf``: it keys the Program row, the ``has_ccdf``
    current-benefit field and every translation. Only the model behind it changed.

    Eligibility is PolicyEngine's; the value is ours. ``ma_ccfa`` itself is not adopted
    here -- it returns $0 for a household reporting no childcare expense, which is most
    of the people screening for a childcare subsidy, and it needs two inputs the screener
    never asks for (provider type and childcare hours per day). So the age table below
    stays, gated on PolicyEngine's answer.

    The last tier runs to CCFA's disabled age limit rather than its general one, so every
    child PolicyEngine claims is priced. Massachusetts covers a child with a diagnosed
    special need to 16 and everyone else to 13, and PolicyEngine applies both bounds, so
    ages 13 to 15 reach the table only when disabled. They are paid the school-age rate.
