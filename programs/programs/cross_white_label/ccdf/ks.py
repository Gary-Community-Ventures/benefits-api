# Appendix F-1, effective 2026-05-01: one row per family size, ordered by band. Each
# entry is the band's *upper* bound on monthly gross income and the monthly Family
# Share Deduction that applies within it. A band's lower bound is one cent above the
# previous band's upper bound and the first starts at $0; the comparison is inclusive
# at the upper bound.
#
# The last band's upper bound is also that family size's 85% SMI income limit --
# these are not two tables but one read two ways, so `income_limit` derives the limit
# from this grid rather than restating it.
#
# The grid resolves Appendix F-1's printing slips; one is load-bearing, the family-of-3
# 170% bound, printed such that $3,870.01-$3,870.09 falls in no band at all. Do not
# transcribe F-1 literally and do not correct the source snapshots.
#
# Stopping at 8 is deliberate, not an incomplete transcription: F-1 publishes sizes
# **2 through 11**, but the screener's household size step validates `.lte(8)`, so no
# form-submitted screen can carry a larger one. `family_size` clamps above 8 rather
# than carrying three rows only the API path could reach. If that form cap is ever
# raised, add sizes 9-11 from the F-1 snapshot before the cap ships.

    Kansas Child Care Assistance Program (KEESM 2810-2840), the state's CCDF subsidy.

    Pays part of the cost of child care for a family with a child under 13 -- or 13
    through 18 and incapable of self-care -- whose income is within 85% of the State
    Median Income and whose countable resources are at or under $10,000. A non-TANF
    family must also have a personal need for care; only KEESM 2820's Maintain
    Employment reason is modelable, so every adult on the case must work an average
    of 20 hours a week at or above the federal minimum wage.

    A plain ``ProgramCalculator`` rather than a subclass of this family's ``Ccdf``
    base: that base wraps PolicyEngine's ``is_ccdf_eligible``, and this program is
    implemented from Kansas sources.

    The value is an **MFB-owned estimate, not an amount DCF publishes**. Kansas sets
    the benefit from its own maximum hourly rate rather than from what the family
    pays, and the two inputs that rate is multiplied by -- provider type and the
    authorized monthly hours -- are unobservable, so the estimate pins a licensed
    centre and the 129-hour part-time block. It understates full-time care by about
    67% and overstates licensed-home and relative care. It also sums over every child
    meeting the age and relationship test, because which children a family requests
    care for is unobservable too.

    Data gaps, in the exclusionary direction: seven of KEESM 2820's eight need reasons
    cannot be established from any screener field and are **not** assumed met, so a
    non-TANF household whose only reason is one of them -- post-secondary education,
    a Job Corps or teen-parent exemption, food assistance E&T, a social-services
    crisis, a foster-care case, KEHS/CC Partnership -- is screened out here. See the
    spec's Data Gaps preamble; the surface is deliberate and has no compensating
    control on the results page.
