"""
SNAP sends `weekly_hours_worked_before_lsr`, and every program on a screen agrees on it.

PolicyEngine removed this field's 40-hour default in 1.815.1. SNAP has to send it or every
adult reads as working zero hours and fails `meets_snap_general_work_requirements` (30 hrs)
and `meets_snap_abawd_work_requirements` (20 hrs) — both ANDed into `is_snap_eligible` for
the whole SPM unit, with no categorical-eligibility override. See MFB-1637.

The second half is the trap. One PolicyEngine request carries every program on the screen,
so two dependencies writing different values to one field and period cannot both be served
by it — payload assembly answers the disagreeing programs with a second request instead
(`build_pe_input`). MA is where that bites: TAFDC and EAEDC approximate at the $15 state
minimum wage while the base class uses the $7.25 federal floor. MaSnap swaps the class so
one MA screen stays one request; the split is the safety net, not the plan.

`pe_input` takes calculator classes here, as the other payload tests do — `pe_period` is a
property needing a configured `Program.year`, and every calculator inherits the same
property object, so the conflict these tests are about resolves to one period key either way.
