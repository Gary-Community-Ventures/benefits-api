    """KS Weatherization Assistance Program — free home energy upgrades
    (insulation, air sealing, heating repair) delivered by Kansas's local
    weatherization subrecipients under a Kansas Housing Resources Corporation
    subgrant.

    Eligibility (see specs/ks.md) is `(criterion 1 OR criterion 3) AND
    criterion 4 AND criterion 5`. Categorical receipt substitutes for the
    income test; it is never ANDed with it.

      * Criterion 1: countable annual income at or below 200% of the federal
        poverty guideline for the household size. The program row's `year` pin
        selects the guideline edition — 2026, whose 200% figures reproduce the
        table KHRC prints on its own application exactly, at every size from 1
        to 16 ($31,920 / $43,280 / $54,640 / $66,000 … $202,320).
      * Criterion 2 defines what "income" means for criterion 1: gross cash
        receipts less the exclusions the current DOE Weatherization Program
        Notice lists. See `excluded_income_types` and
        `student_excluded_income_types`.
      * Criterion 3: categorical income eligibility. Kansas admits a household
        currently receiving SSI, TANF (which Kansas administers as TAF) or
        LIEAP, and has also taken both DOE expansions to HUD and USDA
        means-tested programs — of which Section 8 / HCV is the only one MFB
        records. Any one of these bypasses the income test outright.
      * Criterion 6 fixes the unit both criteria measure over: WAP's family
        unit is everyone living in the dwelling. `household_size` and the
        entered member list are used as entered, never reconstructed from
        tax-unit or relationship fields — the Kansas LIEAP convention.

    Handled outside the calculator:
      * Criterion 4 (at least one citizen or Qualified Alien resides at the
        address) — the program's `legal_status_required` config, which commits
        to citizen / gc_5plus / gc_5less / refugee / otherWithWorkPermission and
        excludes the generic `non_citizen`.
      * Criterion 5 (the dwelling is in Kansas) — white-label routing. Each
        subrecipient must serve the whole of its own territory, so service area
        adds no restriction inside Kansas.
      * Priority order (emergencies; then age 60+, disabled, families with
        children 18 or under; then high energy use or burden). These set the
        order of a waiting list among households already eligible, not whether
        one qualifies.

    Data gaps, none of which the calculator treats as disproving eligibility:
      * The HUD and USDA categorical routes beyond Section 8 / HCV, and cash
        assistance received earlier in the preceding twelve months, are
        affirmative pathways MFB cannot observe. Absence of a record is not
        read as proof the pathway does not apply — but neither is it inferred
        true, which would resolve the eligibility disjunction for every Kansas
        household and reduce criterion 1 to dead code. They are disclosed to
        the user in the program description instead.
      * `selfEmployment`, `rental`, `boarder` and `investment` are dropped in
        full because MFB cannot produce the net figures the notice counts (see
        `excluded_income_types`). This is the one inclusive proxy that can
        produce an actionable false positive.
      * The full-time high-school-student disregard is applied to any full-time
        student regardless of age, because MFB records no level of schooling.
        Over-excluding lowers countable income, so it can only widen results.
      * Income is compared as the annualized current recurring figure MFB
        holds. `IncomeStream` carries no dates, so Kansas's twelve-month and
        three-month-annualized methods cannot be reproduced.
      * Occupancy of the dwelling applied for, dwelling type, and the 15-year
        re-weatherization bar are not collected at all.

    SNAP is deliberately absent. Kansas's categorical list names SSI, TANF and
    LIEAP, and the DOE expansions reach HUD and USDA programs — not SNAP. So
    unlike `tx_wap`, `cowap` and `wa_wap`, SNAP receipt does not qualify here.

    Benefit value is a flat $7,475 — Kansas's most recently published average
    program-operations cost per dwelling unit ($7,474.93, 2025 state plan),
    rounded to the dollar. `value_format: lump_sum` on the program row: the
    measures are installed once, and this estimates the in-kind work rather
    than promising a payment.
