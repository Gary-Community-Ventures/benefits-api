## Overview

The `import_program_config` Django management command allows you to create new programs with all associated entities (categories, warning messages, documents, and navigators) from a single JSON configuration file. This tool:

- Creates programs with automatic translation to all supported languages
- Supports both creating new entities and referencing existing ones
- Validates required fields and provides helpful error messages
- Runs all operations in a database transaction (rollback on error)
- Includes a dry-run mode to preview changes before applying them

## Quick Start

### Import All Pending Programs (Recommended)

Similar to Django migrations, this command imports all program configs that haven't been imported yet:

```bash
# See what would be imported (dry run)
python manage.py import_all_program_configs --dry-run

# Import all pending configs
python manage.py import_all_program_configs

# Check status of all config files
python manage.py import_all_program_configs --list
```

### Import a Single Program

```bash
python manage.py import_program_config programs/management/commands/import_program_config_data/data/<config_file>.json
```

---

## import_all_program_configs Command

This command works like Django migrations - it tracks which program configs have been imported and only processes new ones.

### Usage

```bash
# Import all pending program configurations
python manage.py import_all_program_configs

# Preview what would be imported (no changes made)
python manage.py import_all_program_configs --dry-run

# Show status of all config files (imported vs pending)
python manage.py import_all_program_configs --list

# Import a specific file only
python manage.py import_all_program_configs --file tx_snap_initial_config.json
```

### How It Works

1. Scans `import_program_config_data/data/` directory for JSON files
2. Checks the `ProgramConfigImport` database table to see which files have already been imported
3. Imports only the pending (new) configuration files
4. Records each successful import in the database

### Options

| Option | Description |
| -------- | ----------- |
| `--dry-run` | Show what would be imported without making any changes |
| `--list` | Display status of all config files (imported or pending) |
| `--file <filename>` | Import a specific file only (still tracks it) |

### Database Tracking

The command uses a `ProgramConfigImport` model to track imports:

| Field | Description |
| ------- | ------------- |
| `filename` | Name of the JSON config file |
| `program_name` | The `name_abbreviated` of the imported program |
| `white_label_code` | The white-label code for this program |
| `imported_at` | Timestamp of when the import occurred |

---

## import_program_config Command

Import a single program from a JSON configuration file.

### Usage

### Basic Command

```bash
python manage.py import_program_config programs/management/commands/import_program_config_data/data/<config_file>.json
```

### Dry Run Mode

Preview what will be created without making any changes:

```bash
python manage.py import_program_config programs/management/commands/import_program_config_data/data/<config_file>.json --dry-run
```

### Example

```bash
# Preview the IL CSFP program import
python manage.py import_program_config programs/management/commands/import_program_config_data/data/il_csfp_initial_config.json --dry-run

# Actually import the program
python manage.py import_program_config programs/management/commands/import_program_config_data/data/il_csfp_initial_config.json
```

## Field Details

### Program Category

**For existing categories**: Only `external_name` is required.

**For new categories**: Must include:
- `external_name` - Unique identifier
- `name` - Display name (translatable)
- `icon` - Icon identifier

Optional:
- `description` - Category description (translatable)
- `tax_category` - Boolean, defaults to false

### Program

**Required**:
- `name_abbreviated` - Short unique identifier for the program

**IMPORTANT - Calculator Naming Convention**:
`name_abbreviated` is how a program finds its calculator. At request time the
lookup runs against the **database row**, not this file:

```python
calculators[program.name_abbreviated]  # resolved from the Program row
```

So the calculator's `program_code` must equal the `name_abbreviated` on the row in
the database. This config seeds that row, which is why the two are written to
match — but a config edited without being reimported will disagree with the row,
and the row is what wins.

For example, for a CSFP program on the `il` white label:
- `programs/programs/cross_white_label/csfp/il.py` declares `program_code = "il_csfp"`
- This config sets `name_abbreviated` to `"il_csfp"`, seeding a row with that value

A mismatch means the program resolves to no calculator. Nothing catches that at
import; it surfaces as the program returning no value.

Naming pattern: `{white_label_code}_{program_short_name}`
- Illinois CSFP: `il_csfp`
- Texas SNAP: `tx_snap`
- Colorado Medicaid: `co_medicaid`

**Translatable fields** (auto-translated to all languages):
- `name` - Full program name
- `description` - Detailed description
- `apply_button_description` - Text for apply button
- `website_description` - Short description for website
- All other text fields

**URL fields** (translatable but NOT auto-translated):
- `learn_more_link` - Informational page URL
- `apply_button_link` - Application page URL

**Configuration fields**:
- `year` - FPL year (e.g., "2025")
- `legal_status_required` - Array of legal status codes
- `external_name` - External identifier (can be same as name_abbreviated)
- `active` - Boolean
- `low_confidence` - Boolean
- `show_on_current_benefits` - Boolean
- `value_format` - Format for benefit values

### Warning Message (Optional)

- `external_name` - REQUIRED
- `calculator` - Defaults to "_show"
- `message` - Warning text (translatable)

### Documents (Optional Array)

**For existing documents**: Only `external_name` is required.

**For new documents**: Must include:
- `external_name` - Unique identifier
- `text` - Document description (translatable)

Optional:
- `link_url` - URL for more information
- `link_text` - Link text (translatable)

### Navigators (Optional Array)

**For existing navigators**: Only `external_name` is required.

**For new navigators**: Must include:
- `external_name` - Unique identifier
- `name` - Navigator name (translatable)
- `email` - Contact email (translatable)
- `description` - Description text (translatable)
- `assistance_link` - URL for assistance (not auto-translated)

Optional:
- `phone_number` - Contact phone number
- `counties` - Array of county names
- `languages` - Array of language codes

## Behavior Notes

### Translations

- All translatable fields are automatically translated to all supported languages
- English text is provided in the JSON config
- Machine translation is applied except for fields marked as `no_auto` (like URLs)
- Manual translations can be updated later through the admin interface

### Existing Entities

- If a program with the same `name_abbreviated` and white label exists, the import is skipped
- Documents, navigators, and categories can be referenced by `external_name` without recreating them
- Warning messages are shared across programs with the same calculator

### Validation

- All required fields are validated before any database changes
- Helpful error messages indicate missing or invalid fields
- The entire import runs in a transaction (all or nothing)

### Dry Run

- Use `--dry-run` flag to see what will be created
- No database changes are made
- Shows all entities that would be created or referenced
- Useful for validating JSON config before actual import

## Workflow: Creating a New Program

### Step 1: Create the Calculator (if needed)

Before importing a program, you need to create the eligibility calculator:

1. **Pick the directory.** A white label's share of a benefit that two or more offer
   goes in the family: `programs/programs/cross_white_label/{benefit}/{wl}.py`. A program
   only one white label offers gets its own directory:
   `programs/programs/white_labels/{wl}/{program}/calculator.py`.
2. **Write the calculator**, declaring the `Program` row it backs

Example for IL CSFP:
```python
# programs/programs/cross_white_label/csfp/il.py
class IlCommoditySupplementalFoodProgram(ProgramCalculator):
    program_code = "il_csfp"  # the Program row's name_abbreviated
```

That is the only registration step. `programs.framework.registry` finds the
calculator by walking the package, so there is no dict to add it to. A class that
declares neither `program_code` nor `abstract=True` raises at import rather than
going unregistered.

A base class that exists only to be subclassed declares itself instead:

```python
class HeadStart(PolicyEngineMembersCalculator, abstract=True):
    ...
```

### Step 2: Write the Tests

Tests live beside the calculator — `cross_white_label/{benefit}/tests/test_{wl}.py` for a
family member, `white_labels/{wl}/{program}/tests/` for a standalone program. Shared
fixtures are in `programs/programs/testing_fixtures/`, and which base class you inherit
depends on the engine:

**A custom (MFB) calculator** computes locally, so it needs a household and an assertion:

```python
from programs.programs.testing_fixtures.custom_calculator import CustomCalculatorTestCase, add_income


class TestIlCsfp(CustomCalculatorTestCase):
    calculator_class = IlCommoditySupplementalFoodProgram
    program_code = "il_csfp"
    white_label_code = "il"
    state_code = "IL"

    def test_eligible_household(self):
        screen = self.make_screen(household_size=2, county="Cook")
        add_income(self.add_member(screen, age=65), 1_200)

        self.assertTrue(self.calculate(screen).eligible)
```

**A PolicyEngine calculator** calls out to PolicyEngine, so its test replays a recorded
cassette instead:

```python
from programs.programs.testing_fixtures.pe_integration import PeIntegrationTestCase, make_screen
```

Both paths, including how to record a cassette and what to do when PolicyEngine promotes a
new version, are covered in [`docs/TESTING.md`](../../../../docs/TESTING.md).

Write one test per scenario in the program's `spec.md`, asserting eligibility **and**
value — a test that only checks eligibility passes while the amount is wrong.

### Step 3: Create the JSON Config File

1. Copy an existing config file from `data/` as a template
2. Update all required fields:
   - **Critical**: `name_abbreviated` must equal the calculator's `program_code`, since it seeds the row the lookup resolves against
   - Update all translatable text (name, description, etc.)
   - Set year, legal statuses, and other config
   - Add documents and navigators as needed

### Step 4: Validate and Import

1. Run with `--dry-run` to validate:
   ```bash
   python manage.py import_program_config programs/management/commands/import_new_program/data/your_config.json --dry-run
   ```
2. Review the output carefully - check all fields
3. Run without `--dry-run` to actually import:
   ```bash
   python manage.py import_program_config programs/management/commands/import_new_program/data/your_config.json
   ```

### Important Notes

- **Calculator First**: Always create the calculator code before importing the program
- **Name Matching**: The `name_abbreviated` in your JSON must exactly match the calculator key
- **One-Time Import**: This tool only creates new programs. Updates require manual database changes or new migrations
- **Category Benefits**: If your program should appear in the "Additional Resources" step, you must also configure it in `configuration/white_labels/{state_code}.py` - see details below

## Critical Integration: Category Benefits

When creating a new program, you may need to update the white label configuration to enable the "I already have this" checkbox functionality in the "Additional Resources" step.

### The Naming Convention Chain

The benefit key in `category_benefits` creates a critical chain that must be consistent:

1. **Config Key**: In `configuration/white_labels/{code}.py`
   ```python
   category_benefits = {
       "food": {
           "benefits": {
               "snap": {  # ← This key is critical!
                   "name": {"_label": "", "_default_message": "SNAP"},
                   "description": {"_label": "", "_default_message": "..."}
               }
           }
       }
   }
   ```

2. **Frontend Field**: In `benefits-calculator/src/Assets/updateScreen.ts`, the benefit key is sent as part of `current_benefits`.

3. **Backend Lookup**: In `screener/models.py`, `has_benefit(name_abbreviated)` checks `self.current_benefits.all()` for a `CurrentBenefit` record whose linked program has a matching `name_abbreviated`

### Multiple Programs, Same Benefit

Multiple programs can check the same benefit field. For example:
- Regular screener: `name_abbreviated = "snap"`
- State variant: `name_abbreviated = "co_snap"`
- Calculator variant: `name_abbreviated = "cesn_snap"`

**All are checked independently** by `has_benefit()` via a direct `name_abbreviated` lookup against `Screen.current_benefits`.

### Adding a New Program with Benefit Checkbox

If your program needs an "I already have this" checkbox:

1. **Add to white label config** (`configuration/white_labels/{code}.py`):
   ```python
   category_benefits = {
       "food": {
           "benefits": {
               "my_program": {  # ← Use a consistent key
                   "name": {"_label": "", "_default_message": "My Program Name"},
                   "description": {"_label": "", "_default_message": "Description"}
               }
           }
       }
   }
   ```

2. **Register the program** with a `name_abbreviated` matching the config key. To group white-label variants of one real-world benefit, give them a shared `Program.base_program` so `has_base_benefit()` matches any variant.

For complete details, see: `configuration/white_labels/_template.py` (lines 243-303)

## Troubleshooting

### "Program already exists"
The program has already been imported. This command only creates new programs.

### "Missing required field"
Check the error message for the specific field and add it to your JSON config.

### "WhiteLabel not found"
Ensure the white label code exists in the database.

### "Year not found"
The FPL year must exist in the FederalPoveryLimit table.

### "Legal status not found"
Verify all legal status codes in the LegalStatus table.

## Examples

See the `data/` directory for complete working examples:
- `il_csfp_initial_config.json` - Illinois CSFP program with navigators

## Development

To add support for new entity types:
1. Add the entity to the JSON schema documentation
2. Create an `_import_<entity>` method following the existing pattern
3. Add translation support if needed using `_bulk_update_entity_translations`
4. Update the dry-run report in `_print_dry_run_report`
5. Add the import call in the `handle` method
