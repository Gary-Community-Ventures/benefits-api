"""
One screen, more than one PolicyEngine request.

Programs on a screen share one payload, so two that want different values for the same input
cannot both be served by it. That used to raise out of payload assembly uncaught and 500
`/api/eligibility/{id}`, losing every program's results over one program's disagreement
`calc_pe_eligibility` now sends one request per group of programs that agree and merges the
results, so a disagreement costs a round trip instead of the response.
