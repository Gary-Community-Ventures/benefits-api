"""
Pytest configuration for integration tests with VCR.

This module configures VCR (Video Cassette Recorder) to record and replay
HTTP interactions during tests. It automatically scrubs sensitive information
from cassettes using VCR's built-in filtering capabilities.

VCR behavior controlled by VCR_MODE environment variable:
- VCR_MODE=none (PRs and push to main): Replays only, never records, errors on any new HTTP request
- VCR_MODE=once (local default): Replays existing interactions, ERRORS if cassette missing new HTTP
  request. Downgraded to `none` inside an xdist worker unless PE_RECORD is set, so a parallel
  run cannot record a missing cassette live (see vcr_record_mode)
- VCR_MODE=new_episodes: Replays existing interactions, records NEW HTTP requests not in cassette
- VCR_MODE=all (production deploy): Never replays, re-records ALL cassettes from scratch

A run that may write a cassette is forced single-process (see pytest_configure): parallel
workers would issue duplicate live calls and race to write the same file.

All integration tests marked with @pytest.mark.integration automatically use VCR.

Two integrations use this harness:
- HUD income limits (integrations/clients/hud_income_limits) — needs HUD_API_TOKEN to record
- PolicyEngine program tests — see programs/framework/tests/
  programs/programs/testing_fixtures/pe_integration.py and docs/TESTING.md
